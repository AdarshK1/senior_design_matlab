# MARV Simulink/Matlab

![MARV Render](img/front_iso_folded_4k_payload.png)

This respository is a collection of matlab scripts and simulation work for our Senior Design project: MARV, a maritime autonomous rescue vehicle.

MARV is a collaboration with Gabe Blanchard, Sam Lunt, Sarah Pasquale and Madeline Rice, while we were all seniors at Penn in the MEAM department.

We received the Francis G. Tatnall Prize in 2020 for "an outstanding project showing ingenuity, proficiency and usefulness." [link](https://www.me.upenn.edu/undergraduate/senior-design/)

The simulation in this repository is built heavily in Simulink, and allowed us to perform a design space optimization on hull dimensions, fiberglass thickness, battery sizing, payload location, and numerous other variables. We simulate both performance over water, as well as basics of impact with water from a drop height of 15 feet. This drop simulation is critical since one of the key premises of NASA's need for this solution is the ability to deploy MARV from a helicopter.
